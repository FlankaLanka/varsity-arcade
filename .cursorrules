# Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

## Working Agreements
- Always read every file in `memory-bank/` before acting.
- Update the Memory Bank and this file immediately after learning new patterns or preferences.
- Prefer absolute paths in tool commands.

## Observations (2025-11-23)
- Repository currently contains only documentation scaffolding; implementation details are TBD.
- Keep instructions from the user visible so resets still follow the Memory Bank workflow.
