# Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

## Working Agreements
- Always read every file in `memory-bank/` before acting.
- Update the Memory Bank and this file immediately after learning new patterns or preferences.
- Prefer absolute paths in tool commands.

## Observations (2025-11-24)
- All multiplayer state (whiteboard and battle) uses Firebase Realtime Database.
- Battle system uses host-based architecture: first member (by sorted user ID) acts as authoritative host.
- Keep instructions from the user visible so resets still follow the Memory Bank workflow.

## Battle System Patterns
- **Projectile IDs**: Must be Firebase-safe (no `.`, `#`, `$`, `[`, `]`). Use `proj-{Date.now()}-{random}-{userId}`.
- **Projectile Ownership**: Each client only writes/updates their own projectiles; only remove your own projectiles from Firebase when they go out of range.
- **Session Init**: Host must clear `battle/projectiles` on new battle to prevent stale bullets.
- **Victory Detection**: Host writes to `battle/gameState`; add fallback `useEffect` watching `enemiesCount === 0` for reliability.
- **Auto-Reset**: When presence count hits 0, reset `gameState.mode` to `'whiteboard'`.
