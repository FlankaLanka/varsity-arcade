# Project Brief

## Purpose
- Establish a persistent Memory Bank for `ai-tutor-nerdy` so every fresh session can recover context quickly.
- Capture the high-level vision, constraints, and open decisions as they become available.

## Problem Statement
Without durable documentation, each memory reset forces rediscovery of requirements, which slows delivery and risks inconsistencies. The Memory Bank is the single source of truth for what the project is, why it matters, and how it should behave.

## Objectives
1. Provide concise, trustworthy summaries of the product, system design, technology choices, and current progress.
2. Keep documents synchronized with reality—update them immediately after material changes.
3. Highlight unknowns so they can be resolved in follow-up conversations.

## Scope
- Document the AI tutor project's goals, user experience expectations, architecture, tech stack, and progress.
- Track workflow conventions (Memory Bank usage, .cursorrules updates, etc.).
- Serve as onboarding guide for future sessions.

## Out of Scope
- Implementing product features (covered elsewhere in the repo).
- Detailed API reference or component-level specs unless they become critical (those should live in dedicated add-on files referenced from here).

## Success Criteria
- Every session starts by reading the Memory Bank and immediately understanding status, blockers, and decisions.
- Documentation stays current (no stale sections older than the last significant change).
- Open questions are clearly logged so they can be resolved quickly.

## Open Questions
- Detailed definition of the "AI tutor" experience (target audience, modalities, success metrics).
- Prioritized feature roadmap.
- Constraints around data privacy, integrations, deployments, or timelines.
