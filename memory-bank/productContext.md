# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
- **Varsity Arcade**: An educational gaming platform that combines classic arcade gameplay with learning mechanics.
- Games teach through gameplay: players solve math problems, vocabulary challenges, and other educational content while playing.
- Deliver engaging, competitive learning experiences with leaderboards and social features.

## Users & Needs
- **Students**: Want to learn through fun, competitive games. Need immediate feedback and progress tracking.
- **Educators**: Need tools to engage students and track learning outcomes.
- **Gamers**: Enjoy classic arcade games with a twist - educational challenges integrated into gameplay.

## User Experience Principles
- **Theme**: Pixelated outer space aesthetic. All UI elements (text, buttons, backgrounds) feel like a retro sci-fi arcade game.
- **Gameplay First**: Learning is integrated seamlessly into gameplay, not forced or intrusive.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual and gameplay feedback for correct/incorrect answers (power-ups, penalties).
- **Competition**: Leaderboards and scoring systems drive engagement and replayability.
- **Accessibility**: Clear visuals, intuitive controls, and responsive design.

## Core Workflows
1. **Game Selection**: User browses arcade hub and selects a game (e.g., "Pac-Man: Math Blitz", "Asteroids: Synonym Shooter").
2. **Gameplay**: User plays the game, solving educational challenges (math problems, vocabulary) to progress.
3. **Feedback**: Immediate visual/gameplay feedback for correct/incorrect answers:
   - Correct: Power-up state, advantage in gameplay
   - Incorrect: Penalty state, increased difficulty
4. **Results**: After session (60 seconds), user sees score, achievements, and leaderboard position.
5. **Social**: Share results, compete on leaderboards, unlock achievements.

## Assumptions / TBD Items
- Detailed curriculum coverage (STEM only? general nerd culture?).
- Modalities (text, code execution, diagrams, voice?).
- Personalization data sources and privacy constraints.

## Risks
- Ambiguous requirements could lead to inconsistent tutor behaviors.
- Without automated tests or evaluations, quality drift may go unnoticed.

## Next Steps for Product Definition
- Confirm audience, tone, and measurable outcomes with stakeholders.
- Enumerate MVP features and stretch goals.
- Define evaluation metrics (learning gains, satisfaction, completion rate, etc.).
